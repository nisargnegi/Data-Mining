Rmarkdown combines markdown markup language with R scripting. 
Rmarkdown notebooks can be knitted to pdf, html or word document.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# This is R code
# This several lines called chunk
# Chunk can have a name, this one has speacial name "setup"
# chunk can have options for its execution, 
# e.g. include=FALSE would not show code or execution output of this 
# chunk in knitted document
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

print("Loading libraries")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
#
```

```{r}
# another chunk
# to execute whole chunk press ctrl-shift-enter
print("Hello World 1!")
print("Hello World 2!")
print("Hello World 3!")
# to execute only one line press ctrl-enter
print("Hello World 4!")
```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) %>% knitr::kable()
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x=temperature, y=pressure))+geom_point()+geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

For the LaTex needs install MiKTeX (on windows it is more reliable than TinyTeX in my experience).
