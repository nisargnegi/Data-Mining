Read and execute this R markdown notebook. \*update the author name and the date in the top header of this notebook. \* knit the pdf document from this notebook (you will need LaTex on your system, try MiKTeX version).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x=temperature, y=pressure))+geom_point()+geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## knit pdf document from this R markdown notebook

For the LaTex needs install MiKTeX (on windows it is more reliable than TinyTeX in my experience).
